    <p>This is a story about my story. No, this isn't about my life, it's about the book I wrote. 
       My book is called, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Birth-Malice-Jason-Schmidt-ebook/dp/B01KNGFFL4" target="_blank"><em><strong>"The Birth of Malice."</strong></em></a> I published it in 2016 on Amazon, first in kindle
       format then eventually in paperback. I never would have written or published it if it wasn't for a series 
       of events that set it all in motion. If you enjoy the story of my story, buy the book on Amazon. Even though
       it's my first book it is highly rated.</p>
    <p>The Birth of Malice is about a normal guy, named Adam, that's caught up in a fight between a group of heroes and villains. In the wake of that
       fight, his wife and daughter are killed. When he's interviewed by the media, he's angry and speaks out about the
       behavior of the heroes, which is something that just isn't done. His speech gets the attention of the man that created
       the heroes and villains. He wants Adam to fix his mistakes, and gifts him with powers. With his new power, he sets out
       to protect people in his own way, but finds that it's a lot more complicated than he could have imagined.</p>

    <p id = "tform">The X-Men were the first comic series I got into</p>
       <p>You could probably say it all started with comic books. Growing up, I loved superheroes.
       Any comic book or animated show that had super powers fascinated me. Marvel or DC, it didn't matter.
       I ate it all up. As I grew older, I became interested in characters like Venom and The Punisher. 
       They weren't pure heroes, nor were they pure villains. I liked that a lot, their personalities were a lot
       more interesting than Superman, who is practically infallible, I thought that was boring. That got me thinking
       about the morality of heroes more. Then I saw the second Christian Bale Batman movie, where Joker could have hurt or
       killed a lot of people. Batman just puts him in prison. It occurred to me how awful that was. Joker was going to
       escape and probably kill more people. If Batman had killed him, he'd save a lot of people. Watching Boondock Saints
       further reinforced this idea.</p>
   
    <p>I'd been thinking about writing a story for many years with all these things in mind. 
       I had a basic plot, characters, and even some basic dialogue on my mind. The whole time 
       I kept thinking it was foolish, who would read it? I'd never written a book before and it seemed daunting. 
       So the story stayed on the backburner for a long time.</p>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>

      <p id = "tform">How did my idea become a reality?</p>
       <p>I graduated from college in 2007 with a degree in criminal justice. My original goal was to become a detective
       so I started applying to police departments. Then the recession hit, there were so many applicants that the 
       departments had a lot of top quality candidates. Unfortunately I wasn't one of them. On top of that I couldn't find any
       work, anywhere. I couldn't even get an officer slot in the military because they had the same issue as the police
       departments. So in 2010 I enlisted in the Air Force as an Airman First Class in Security Forces.</p>
      <p>Security forces is essentially law enforcement and security for the Air Force. What I didn't know at the time
       was it was renowned for having high suicide rates, incredibly low morale, and awful leadership. My first year was
       pretty bad, twelve to fourteen hour shifts, losing days off because of other people, heavily punished over small things.
       I won't go over every last thing that happened, it would take a lot of space, but the last straw was a Staff Sergeant in
       Kuwait. I'd just missed the birth of my first daughter because I was deployed to Kuwait. I was fine though, and in a
       fairly good mood. Unfortunately my head was in the clouds and I forgot my gear bag back in the squadron. It wasn't a
       big deal, I had all the important gear with me, all that was in the bag was stuff I didn't use, like a whistle and
       flashlight (I worked day shifts.) To the new staff sergeant that was six years younger than me, it was apparently the
       end of the world. He made the rest of my day hell, and it made me realize I needed to do something positive. I wanted
       to be my own boss and not have to deal with stupid leadership anymore. I knew it was a stretch, but becoming an author
       appealed to me and gave me something positive to do. So I decided to finally write my story. So yes, I was inspired 
       to finally write by a long series of unfortunate events and by a crappy new NCO that nobody liked.</p>

    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <img src = "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQQNpnYk74gjFX2Xnz1nTCoYY_U6cSmIDSuaBOH2Ck0L9d52SoI" height="500" width = "800" />
      <p id = "tform">Thank god for word processors</p>
         <p>My first few chapters were written in Kuwait, then I returned to my home station in Okinawa, Japan where I continued to write. We still had long 
         shifts, but I wrote whenever I could. As I went, I researched how to do dialogue, and other things I encountered
         along the way. Months later I was diagnosed with a serious medical problem. I couldn't stay in Okinawa anymore,
         so the Air Force sent us back to the states permanently for my treatment. The treatment itself left me exhausted,
         sick, and weak. I was still motivated to write through it all. My health was still not improving after a year and
         a half, so the Air Force medically retired me in 2014.</p>
      <p>I was still having a lot of doubts about publishing my story. There was also the fact that I had no idea how to publish,
         obtain cover art, or even how to get a professional editor. I finished my draft of the story and my own editing 
         in late 2015, but I was stuck. Fortunately my sister worked at Amazon, and knew a great editor that helped me out
         a lot. Months later the story was finally polished and ready to go. It was around April 2016, I'd been searching
         for months trying to find a great way to get a book cover. Finally when I gave up, my wife's uncle came to my rescue.
         He was a photography professor at George Fox University here in Oregon. We were at a family function and he asked
         how my book was going. I mentioned the trouble with the cover and he said, "I could assign it as an assignment for
         my photography class. I'm always looking for ideas for new assignments." At the time I thought it sounded kind of
         weird, so I told him I'd think about it. After a few days of thinking about it, I realized it was the best 
         opportunity I'd get. There would be a lot of professional looking options to choose from. So I accepted his offer.
         The pictures ranged from incredibly weird, to a few really beautiful pictures. My wife has an eye for photography
         and art, so together we chose the picture that is now the cover of my book.</p>
      <p>It was now August of 2016, I had everything put together and I was ready to publish. I began walking through the
         steps of self-publishing with Amazon. Everything was entered, all that was left was to hit the publish button. Self
         doubt creeped in again. What if nobody read my book, or worse, what if it was really terrible and everyone hated it?
         Maybe through all this time people were telling me my story was good, but they didn't want to hurt my feelings, like
         those terrible American Idol contestants that thought they could sing but couldn't. I realized, I'd never know if I
         didn't try. So I published it, let as many people know as I could, and I waited. My first reviews were all really positive
         and book sales were slow but steady. I was now a published author and thrilled about it.</p>

       <p id = "tform">Where will I go with my writing?</p>
          <p>My first book has received great reviews and I'm currently working on the sequel. I'm nearly finished with the
          first draft of it. I think it's even better than the first and I can't wait to publish it. If everything falls 
          into place, I think it'll be published in 2019. I know there will be some setbacks, particularly because I'll be
          very busy the rest of this year. My main challenges are still getting word out about my book. I'm not an advertiser
          and I despise social media. Right now my plan is to just keep writing and publishing. I've often found that when
          I relax and let things happen that they tend fall into place on their own. Who knows, maybe I'll be a best-selling
          author someday.</p>
