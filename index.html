    <p>This is a story about my story. No, this isn't about my life, it's about the book I wrote. 
       My book is called, <em><strong>"The Birth of Malice."</strong></em> I published it in 2016 on Amazon, first in kindle
       format then eventually in paperback. I never would have written or published it if it wasn't for a series 
       of events that set it all in motion. If you enjoy the story of my story, buy the book on Amazon. Even though
       it's my first book it is highly rated.</p>

    <p>You could probably say it all started with comic books. Growing up, I loved superheroes.
       Any comic book or animated show that had super powers fascinated me. Marvel or DC, it didn't matter.
       I ate it all up. As I grew older, I became interested in characters like Venom and The Punisher. 
       They weren't pure heroes, nor were they pure villains. I liked that a lot, their personalities were a lot
       more interesting than Superman, who is practically infallible, I thought that was boring. That got me thinking
       about the morality of heroes more. Then I saw the second Christian Bale Batman movie, where Joker could have hurt or
       killed a lot of people. Batman just puts him in prison. It occurred to me how awful that was. Joker was going to
       escape and probably kill more people. If Batman had killed him, he'd save a lot of people. Watching Boondock Saints
       further reinforced this idea.</p>
   
    <p>I'd been thinking about writing a story for many years with all these things in mind. 
       I had a basic plot, characters, and even some basic dialogue on my mind. The whole time 
       I kept thinking it was foolish, who would read it? I'd never written a book before and it seemed daunting. 
       So the story stayed on the backburner for a long time.</p>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
      <p>I graduated from college in 2007 with a degree in criminal justice. My original goal was to become a detective
       so I started applying to police departments. Then the recession hit, there were so many applicants that the 
       department had top quality candidates. Unfortunately I wasn't one of them. On top of that I couldn't find any
       work, anywhere. I couldn't even get an officer slot in the military because they had the same issue as the police
       departments. So in 2010 I enlisted in the Air Force as an Airman First Class in Security Forces.</p>
      <p>Security forces is essentially law enforcement and security for the air force. What I didn't know at the time
       was it was renowned for having high suicide rates, incredibly low morale, and awful leadership. My first year was
       pretty bad, twelve to fourteen hour shifts, losing days off because of other people, heavily punished over small things.
       I won't go over every last thing that happened, it would take a lot of space, but the last straw was a Staff Sergeant in
       Kuwait. I'd just missed the birth of my first daughter because I was deployed to Kuwait. I was fine though, and in a
       fairly good mood. Unfortunately my head was in the clouds and I forgot my gear bag back in the squadron. It wasn't a
       big deal, I had all the important gear with me, all that was in the bag was stuff I didn't use, like a whistle and
       flashlight (I worked day shifts.) To the new staff sergeant that was six years younger than me, it was apparently the
       end of the world. He made the rest of my day hell, and it made me realize I needed to do something positive. So I 
       decided to finally write my story. So yes, I was inspired to finally write by a crappy new NCO that nobody liked.</p>
