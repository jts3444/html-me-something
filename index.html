  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is a story about my story. No, this isn't about my life, it's about the book I wrote. 
       My book is called, <em><strong>"The Birth of Malice."</strong></em> I published in 2016 on Amazon, first in kindle
       format then eventually in paperback. I never would have written or published it if it wasn't for a series 
       of events that set it all in motion. If you enjoy the story of my story, buy the book on Amazon. Even though
       it's my first book it is highly rated.</p>

  <h2>Comics</h2>
    <p>You could probably say it all started with comic books. Growing up, I loved superheroes.
       Any comic book or animated show that had super powers fascinated me. Marvel or DC, it didn't matter.
       I ate it all up. As I grew older, I became interested in characters like Venom and The Punisher. 
       They weren't pure heroes, nor were they pure villains. I liked that a lot, their personalities were a lot
       more interesting than Superman, who is practically infallible, I thought that was boring. That got me thinking
       about the morality of heroes more. Then I saw the second Christian Bale Batman movie, where Joker could have hurt or
       killed a lot of people. Batman just puts him in prison. It occurred to me how awful that was. Joker was going to
       escape and probably kill more people. If Batman had killed him, he'd save a lot of people. Watching Boondock Saints
       further reinforced this idea.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>I'd been thinking about writing a story for many years with all these things in mind. 
       I had a basic plot, characters, and even some basic dialogue on my mind. The whole time 
       I kept thinking it was foolish, who would read it? I'd never written a book before and it seemed daunting. 
       So the story stayed on the backburner for a long time.</p>
